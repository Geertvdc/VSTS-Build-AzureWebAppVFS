# Azure WebApp Virtual File System Tasks

## Deleting files
Delete files from Azure Web Apps through KUDU Virtual File System Rest API (Put & Get coming soon)

This task was created because sometimes web apps create certain files containing configuration after initial deployments. This task helps you reset your web app to a certain state wehre resetting the full directory isn't an option (otherwise use Webdeploy's advanced parameter called "Remove Additional Files at Destination")

Using the task is easy: fill in the following parameters:

- Azure subscription (select your Azure RM connection)
- App Service Name (select the web app you want to delete files at)
- File URL (enter the file url within the wwwroot that you want to delete. use path ending on / for directories)

optionally add the following parameters

- Recursive delete (Default **ON** if you select a directory also delete all files and directories in this directory)
- Skip non existing path (If file or directory does not exist any more do not throw error but continue)
- Allow self signed certificates (**only use this when you you run in an ASE and have your own certificates**)
- Alternative kudu URL (When running in ASE and the SCM url is different fill in the exact url here)
